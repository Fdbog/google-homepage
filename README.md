# Fdbog's google-homepage
#One issue I ran into doing this project was trying to get the google .svg logo to display in Chrome. Turned out to be above my head so I left it. From what I understand it's a limitation with the <img> tag and not supporting .svg. I tried to use the <object> tag but it didn't work, and broke firefox. 

#Overall I think I nailed a lot of the styling, though my div layout could be a lot better.
